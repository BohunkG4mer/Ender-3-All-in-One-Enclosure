These are the Autodesk Inventor source files.

Parts and their discription:

## Base Left No Front Panel:
This is the left half of the main base. It doesn't have a front panel which makes printing much faster than previous versions of the enclosure.  The front panel is a separate part.

## Base Right No Front Panel:
This is the right half of the main base. It doesn't have a front panel which makes printing much faster than previous versions of the enclosure.  The front panel is a separate part.

## Base Left Front Panel:
This screws onto the base left part using M3x8 screws.  

## Base Right Front Panel:
This screws onto the base right part using M3x8 screws.  

## Base Cover Left:
This screws into the top of the base to cover it using M3x8 screws.

## Base Cover Right:
This screws into the top of the base to cover it using M3x8 screws.

## RPi 3 Mount:
This is the Raspberry Pi3 mount module.  Screws onto the right base with M3x6 screws.  The Pi screws to it using M2.5x6 screws.

## Regulator Mount: 
This is for mounting LM2596 regulators and the MOSFET modules from Amazon.  Screws to the base using M3x6 screws.

## Base Left Front Panel Card Reader

## Base Cover Left 80mm Fan
For use with a 80x10 or 80x25 fan.  Fan will mount on top of the cover as there's probably not sufficient room under it.  A 80x10 fan might work under the cover, but a 80x25 will definitely not.
