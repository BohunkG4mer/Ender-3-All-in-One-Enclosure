### Initial Release on Github
- Initial Release on Github

## [1.0.1] - 2018-12-05
### Small Change to Board Mounting Holes
- Increased outer diameter of the mounting holes in the Base Left and Base right as I was still experiencing some breaking off when tightening the screws.  Updated both the source files and STL files accordingly.  New outer diameter is 7mm, increased from 5mm in previous versions.

## [2.0.0] - 2018-12-05
### Major revision to the enclosure.  
- Removed front panel and made it a separate part for each half of the base.  This greatly reduces printing time compared to the old version.  The front panels screw onto the front of the base using M3 screws.
-Removed vertical grills from the back part of the base pieces.  Not only did they serve no purpose because they were against the 4040 extrusion in the back anyway, they increased printing time by a lot due to the printer having to print lots of individual towers instead of just one big wall.

## [2.0.1] - 2018-1-13
### Added Base Left Front Panel SD Reader.  
- This allows you to use a Arduino SD Card reader with your MKS mainboard.  Untested.
